title: Cost Shifting
---

In the United States, the rates the government pays to hospitals through Medicare and Medicaid.
are lower than the rates private payers pay to hospitals.
The idea that hopsitals charge higher rates for private payers in order to 
make up for the lower government rates is called cost shifting.
Economists and health policy analysts disagree over the validity of cost shifting.  
One study by Austin Frakt found that cost shifting occurs rarely.
