Imagine that you are at a casino, playing the newest game they offer.  To play one game, you pay five dollars.  In one game, you get to flip ten coins.  For each head you get, you’ll win one dollar.

This game seems like a good way to kill your boredom, so you casually sit yourself at the table and pay five dollars.  Eagerly, you get to flipping those ten coins.

Tails!
<br/>
Tails!
<br/>
Tails!

An inauspicious start, you think to yourself.

Tails!
<br/>
Tails!
<br/>
Tails!

A scowl creeps onto your face.  

Tails!
<br/>
Tails!
<br/>
Tails!

Not a surprising result.  Ok, last chance!
<br/>
<br/>
Tails!
<br/>
<br/>
A fitting conclusion.
<br/>
<br/>
You must have gotten rid of your bad luck out of your system with that first game.  Time to get serious.
<br/>
<br/>
Next game, one head.
<br/>
The game after, three heads.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, you know something’s up with those coins you’ve been flipping.  The odds of flipping one coin and getting a head is definitely not 50%.  To try to guess the odds of getting a head in one flip, you mull over the results of the three games you played.
