# Maximum Likelihood Estimates

## Cascade of Coins

Imagine that you are at a casino, playing the newest game they offer.  To play one game, you pay five dollars.  In one game, you get to flip ten coins.  For each head you get, you’ll win one dollar.

This game seems like a good way to kill your boredom, so you casually sit yourself at the table and pay five dollars.  Eagerly, you get to flipping those ten coins.

Tails!
<br/>
Tails!
<br/>
Tails!

An inauspicious start, you think to yourself.

Tails!
<br/>
Tails!
<br/>
Tails!

A scowl creeps onto your face.  

Tails!
<br/>
Tails!
<br/>
Tails!

Not a surprising result.  Ok, last chance!
<br/>
<br/>
*Tails!*
<br/>
<br/>
A fitting conclusion.
<br/>
<br/>
You must have gotten rid of your bad luck out of your system with that first game.  Time to get serious.
<br/>
<br/>
Next game, one head.
<br/>
The game after, three heads.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, you know something’s up with those coins you’ve been flipping.  The odds of flipping one coin and getting a head is definitely not 50%.  To try to guess the odds of getting a head in one flip, you mull over the results of the three games you played.

| Game # | Results |
| ------ | --- |
|First Game| 0 heads|
|Second Game| 1 head|
| Third Game | 3 heads|

If the odds of a head were 50%, these results seem unlikely.
<br/>
If the odds of a head were 40%, these results seem unlikely.  However, your results are more likely if the odds were 40% than if the odds were 50%.  So we seem to be getting closer to the real odds of a head.
<br/>
<br/>
As we keep looking at smaller and smaller odds of heads, your results start to become more likely given those odds.  Eventually, we’ll reach a point where the results of the three games are the most likely with some odds of heads.  Let’s call this specific chance our **estimate**.
<br/>
<br/>
Since our estimate gave us the highest chance of getting what actually happened compared to our past guesses for the odds of heads, we call this estimate the **maximum likelihood estimate**.
<br/>
<br/>
The process we just used is useful to guess the odds of heads when we don’t actually know those odds.  We could try to ask the casino operators what the odds are, but they are a tight-lipped bunch.
<br/>
<br/>
The process of finding the maximum likelihood estimate can be used in other situations as well.  In our unprofitable coin flip games, the possible number of heads went from zero to 10.  We could use the maximum likelihood estimate for situations where the possible number of outcomes is infinite.  Let’s take a look at one such example.
<br/>
## Road Trips and Smiles

Every year, you and your friends take a road trip.  For reasons lost to time, Sam is the one who has to buy the gas.  Sam always buys some random amount of gas based on how happy he is.
<br/>
<br/>
You and your friends drive along until you run out of gas.  The distance you and your friends drive depends on Sam’s happiness.  So, based on the distances of your road trips each year, you can estimate how happy Sam is.
<br/>
<br/>
Like flipping coins, we can find the happiness level that makes the past, actual distances the most likely.  While we could ask Sam how happy they are, Sam might not have a good idea.  Instead, we can make a decent estimate based on how far those road trips went.
<br/>
## Summary
Looking back at both the coin-flipping game and the road trips, we see we can use **maximum likelihood estimates** to guess the odds of an event happening based on what we experience.
