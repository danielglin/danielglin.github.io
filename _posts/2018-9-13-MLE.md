Cascade of Coins

Imagine that you are at a casino, playing the newest game they offer. 
To play one game, you pay five dollars. In one game, you get to flip ten coins. For each head you get, you’ll win one dollar.

This game seems like a good way to kill your boredom, so you casually sit yourself at the table and pay five dollars. Eagerly, you get to flipping those ten coins.

Tails! 
Tails! 
Tails!

An inauspicious start, you think to yourself.

Tails! 
Tails! 
Tails!

A scowl creeps onto your face.

Tails! 
Tails! 
Tails!

Not a surprising result. Ok, last chance! 

Tails! 

A fitting conclusion.
